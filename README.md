# Hello! This project is a data analysis project related to the stats of 1000+ FIFA 23 players. 

The first file is a web-scraper created in Python using the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries to gather information looping from
'https://www.futhead.com/23/players/2' to 'https://www.futhead.com/23/players/1023'. This section of the project was created entirely by myself. 

The next section is currently under progress, but will be a static application created using Angular to create the most optimal lineup and formation given a set of players. This will be created by both myself and a friend of mine, since he is more well-versed in Angular and web-development, while I am more well-versed in data analysis. 

The last section, also under progress, will be visualizing the data obtained in an easily readable and accessible manner. This will be done using Tabular, a software that I am experienced in and immensely useful for visualizing data.
